Because the "drawing" implementation is inefficient, the screen will clear and reprint the 
game rapidly. So, FLASHING SCREEN WARNING

So I wrote this in the summer of 2019, the year right before I started college.

I admit, it's not the most efficient implementation of "drawing" the game on screen, but
I was but a wee lad. The objective of this project was largely to get practice with Python.

Also, because the "drawing" implementation is not great, the screen will clear and reprint the 
game rapidly. So, FLASHING SCREEN WARNING
